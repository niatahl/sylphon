		"[Sylphon RnD] When outfitting a Sylphon vessel, keep in mind that the outfitting interface doesn't take the energy weapon flux discount of nullspace conduits into account for the displayed weapon flux per second.",
		"[Sylphon RnD] Many special effects of Sylphon shipsystems or hullmods affect ships based on whether they have nullspace conduits, not which side they are on.",
		"[Sylphon RnD] When overloaded in a Sylphon ship, try staying close to allies with nullspace conduits. They can take the uncontrolled lightning hits without much damage, which is usually preferable to the lightning frying your engines instead.",
