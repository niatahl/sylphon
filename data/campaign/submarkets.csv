Installation",sylphon,"Several AI-cores within the Sylphon volunteer to be permanently embedded in ships. While their reasons differ, they all end up in this location; here, the Sylphon offer their closest allies to receive one of these volunteering cores in exchange for other cores they may have procured, to make up for lost workforce.

Drop off Sylphon-made ships here together with a properly-dimensioned AI core (Beta for destroyer and below, Alpha for cruiser and larger), and it will have a core installed once you leave. Note that this will mothball the ship in the process.",data.scripts.campaign.submarkets.SRD_AIConversion,graphics/sylphon/factions/sylphon_ai_installing.png,200
