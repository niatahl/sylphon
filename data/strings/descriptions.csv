# Ships,,,,,
,,,,,
SRD_Equilibrium,SHIP,"The largest known vessel employed by Sylphon, the Equilibrium is a unique wing-shaped dreadnought with terrifying frontal firepower. Designed to engage enemies head-on it is equipped with a unique shield generator tied to its massive nullspace conduit system, granting it unparalleled frontal protection although it is incompatible with most conventional shielding technology. While seemingly vulnerable to flanking, the Equilibrium possesses surprising agility for a ship of its size by utilizing its nullspace skip system to quickly reposition or turn in battle, using excess energies to power a fast and volatile shield deployment system.

The result of a lengthy and expensive development initiative, the Equilibrium is the de-facto flagship of the Sylphon fleet. Utilizing countless advanced technologies it is a marvel of modern engineering in an age of common technological stagnation. While designed for military purposes, the vessel’s interior would have one think otherwise with spacious corridors and comfortable crew accomodations, a result of its high level of automation and employment of multiple AI cores, keeping the crew requirements low. With a multitude of civilian and scientific facilities, aswell as large logistical hangar bays, the ship can serve as a mobile base for both military and civilian operations.",,,
SRD_Seresvalla,SHIP,"A pinnacle of Sylphon engineering, the Seresvalla-class battlecruiser was built around a massive nullspace conduit, often referred to as soother, that is capable of generating a massive nullspace stabilization field. Capable of encompassing any normal battlescape, it provides all conduit-equipped vessels with enhanced mobility by boosting their skimming capabilities. These supporting abilities are augmented by a flux transfer system, capable of lowering the strain on allied flux grids and weaponizing excess flux.

While technically undergunned for a ship of its size, the Seresvalla boasts superior mobilitiy and can be equipped with powerful strike weapons, making it a favourite of many Sylphon fleet commanders.",,,
SRD_Rakia,SHIP,"To some known as the crown jewel of 5th generation Sylphon engineering, the Rakia is a ship without equal. An experimental design constructed around a modified phase coil that has been integrated with a massive conduit, as well as an oversized ion blaster, it is an excessively complex design.

The final product of years of research, the Rakia is the first ship capable of sustaining nullspace flight for extended periods of time, possessing a battlefield presence similar to phase ships but avoiding some of their major downfalls. Relying on AI to be reasonably controlled while under the effects of nullspace-induced hyperagility, the ship has proven impossible to control by normal humans and the complexity of its internal components has left little room for human-sized maintenance ducts, requiring full automation of many maintenance systems. What little interior space is available for human crew can only be described as cramped, but for all the discomfort the Rakia offers to its crew, serving aboard this marvel of Sylphon engineering is regarded as great honor to anyone in the Sylphon navy.

Augmenting its unique capabilities of nullspace travel is a suite of weapons uniquely designed for the Rakia. The massive Equity-type superheavy ion blaster and a pair of Harrow-type micromissile-batteries provide the ship with a disturbing amount of firepower while the armor polarization system adapted from 4th Generation vessels, gives it unparalleled protection from initial return fire, capable of buying enough time for the Rakia to retreat back into nullspace after unleashing its frightening alpha strike, often leaving targets crippled and easy prey to other Sylphon ships.",,,
SRD_Silverhead,SHIP,"One of the first ships equipped with nullspace conduit, the Silverhead may look similar to the Hammerhead-class destroyer it was based on, but this impression can be quite deceiving. Now converted to an all-energy weapons loadout and a nullspace skip system, the Silverhead has established itself as an agile combatant, capable of dictating its engagements as it pleases.",,,
SRD_Eagle,SHIP,"A modified variant of the common Eagle chassis, the Dread Eagle earned its name from its unusual hull structure, often described as unsettlingly organic-looking. In combination with its advanced nullspace jaunt system, allowing it to appear seemingly out of nowhere, it is said to instill dread in the bridge crews of any ship unlucky enough to encounter the Dread Eagle face to face.

The actual ship boasts a number of advanced upgrades over its older base design, carrying a larger weapons complement and improved shields.",,,
SRD_Hymnon,SHIP,"A delicate piece of engineering, the Hymnon was built around its oversized main weapon, dedicating half of its mass to it. With flux conduits barely capable of containing the massive energy flow, not much capacity is left for other weapons, shields or drives.

While generally limited in its range of application, it often finds a place in escort fleets due to its ability to swat whole fighter squadrons out of existence.",,,
SRD_Furika,SHIP,"A heavily overgunned frigate that relies on its nullspace shunt system to sustain its fire. Popular with more aggressive novice captains for it’s ability to unleash highly destructive barrages, the Furika is quite commonly seen throughout the sector in the hands of upstart mercenaries.",,,
SRD_Celika,SHIP,"Fully automated and equipped with an advanced nullpoint barrier system, this tiny brawler is best not to be underestimated. While not as well armed as some other frigates, the defensive capabilities of the Celika make it a difficult to kill opponent whose nullpoint barrier can turn any fight around when used smartly.

While Sylphon RnD insist the ship is controlled by standard automatic control systems as found in fighter drones, rumors say that the ships are controlled by at least gamma level Ais, based on their unusual combat prowess.",,,
SRD_Finis_Astra,SHIP,"More a mobile siege weapon than an actual ship, the Finis Astra is the largest vessel constructed at Sylphon’s own yards in small quantities. Smaller than most capital ships and only lightly armed with conventional weaponry, the chassis is designed for the sole purpose of carrying the massive Götterdämmerung siege laser. Capable of laying waste to a planet’s surface from high orbit, it is best not thought as a mere anti-planetary weapon however. While using the weapon at its full power requires the ship to power down most other systems including weapons, shields and drives, it can fire at a lower power setting in space combat, still capable of annihilating smaller ships in a single blast.

The exact purpose of this weapon is subject to a lot of speculation as Sylphon have never made any attempt at expanding their influence past their few base facilities and there are no known sales of Finis Astras to other parties.",,,
SRD_Omega_Aeterna,SHIP,CLASSIFIED,,,
SRD_Tarima,SHIP,"Constructed around its pair of heavy Veritas gauss drivers this destroyers boasts great versatility thanks to the weapons’ unique functionality. Otherwise an unremarkable ship, the Tarima lives and dies by its commander’s ability to leverage these powerful weapons to good effect.",,,
SRD_Catharsis,SHIP,"More expensive to build than most frigates, this overengineered and armed to the teeth fighter is capable of dominating an airspace all by itself. Something it often has to, given the fragility of most other Sylphon-produced fighters.",,,
SRD_Spectral,SHIP,"A tiny drone fighter, designed to be easily replaced, it isn’t very good at anything and generally only found in integrated autofactories of Sylphon vessels that lack the hangar space for proper strike craft.",,,
SRD_Okarra,SHIP,"A new heavy cruiser employing nanolaminate armor, the Okarra is far sturdier than most Sylphon vessels. Designed as part of a three ship series to test the viability of the recently developed polarizer for nanolaminate armor in combat, the ship has proven itself since and entered regular production. While the complex polarizer system doesn't allow the installation of a Sylphon-grade shield generator, the standard shielding is still sufficiently efficient in combination with the unusually heavy armor for an SRD vessel.",,,
SRD_Etrika,SHIP,"A heavy destroyer from a new line of nanolaminate armor vessels, this unusual Sylphon design completely forgoes the usual high efficiency shield generator for layers of advanced armor and an advanced armor polarizer system. Taking advantage of the lack of a flux-hungry shield, the Etrika is a heavily overgunned destroyer that relies on its ability to quickly overwhelm enemy ships through its offensive capabilities before it can sustain heavy damage.",,,
SRD_Catora,SHIP,"The smallest vessel of Sylphon's new line of armored ships, replacing the usual efficient shielding with newly developed nanolaminate armor that can be polarized to make it near impenetrable for short amounts of time, it boasts an impressive array of small weapon mounts, using the flux capacity freed up by the lack of shielding. While the ship lacks staying power, its ability to charge at the enemy, guns blazing, to crush them in a single assault is not to be underestimated.",,,
SRD_Hubris,SHIP,"An older design predating the common use of nullspace conduits in Sylphon vessels, the Hubris is a reliable support carrier that remains in use with the SRD for lack of alternatives more than anything. With nullspace conduits requiring large amounts of internal space and their benefits not being as synergetic with carrier applications, the Hubris has remained a solid choice since its introduction and is commonly seen supporting Sylphon's newer vessels from behind the frontlines.",,,
SRD_Mariana_cargo,SHIP,"Freighter variant of the Mariana heavy transport.

A massive modular transport vessel, the Mariana itself is mostly a structural frame containing drive units, loading hangars and crew quarters. This basic frame can be docked with one of several massive functionality units to convert the ship into a freighter, tanker or other type of logistics vessel. While it ultimately suffers in raw efficiency compared to vessels built for a singular purpose, its versatility is highly valued by Sylphon's logistics devision and the enhanced defenses compared to most other ships of its class has proven a great boon at times.",,,
SRD_Mariana_fuel,SHIP,"Tanker variant of the Mariana heavy transport. 

A massive modular transport vessel, the Mariana itself is mostly a structural frame containing drive units, loading hangars and crew quarters. This basic frame can be docked with one of several massive functionality units to convert the ship into a freighter, tanker or other type of logistics vessel. While it ultimately suffers in raw efficiency compared to vessels built for a singular purpose, its versatility is highly valued by Sylphon's logistics devision and the enhanced defenses compared to most other ships of its class has proven a great boon at times.",,,
SRD_Cicerone,SHIP,An advanced support drone built around a modified clemency class discharge emitter making them highly effective against hostile strike craft and missiles.,,,
SRD_Eos,SHIP,A powerful drone fighter with a pair of embrace cyclers.,,,
SRD_Ascordia,SHIP,"One of the most recent additions to the Sylphon roster, the Ascordia is an advanced automated destroyer that can punch far above its weight class. This power comes at an appropriate pricepoint however, making the ship a rare sight.",,,
SRD_Valestri,SHIP,An overgunned heavy cruiser that relies heavily on its nullspace shunt system to maintain its assault due to a massively overburdened flux system.,,,
SRD_Zodiark,SHIP,CLASSIFIED,,,
SRD_Buffalo,SHIP,"A fully automated version of the common Buffalo, allowing Sylphon fleets to maintain their supply lines with less personnel. An ability made mandatory by the group’s constant lack of manpower.",,,
SRD_Frelia,SHIP,"One of the newest 5th generation ship designs recent put into service by Sylphon, the Frelia is a powerful battlecarrier, capable of providing Sylphon fleets with fighter support aswell as acting as a respectable frontline fighter. The fully automated hangar bays were designed specifically to service drone fighters, in compliance with Sylphon's low manpower requirements. While this limits outfitting options, the specialized bays work more efficiently than those found on regular carriers.

The first Sylphon carrier to be outfitted with nullspace conduits, the Frelia is also the first vessel to employ nulltech-equipped drones, carrying a wing of Skallic Drones. Able to deploy these powerful capacitor-powered barrage drones within firing range of enemy vessels via nullspace travel, it is capable of devastating fighter strikes before recalling the drones to recharge. While currently incompatible with bombers carrying volatile payloads, a future application of nulltech to a bomber such as the new Sadri would prove a truly fearsome prospect.",,,
SRD_Sadri,SHIP,"A newly developed torpedo bomber carrying a single Iphrail torpedo. While decently shielded, its fairly large frame makes it an easier target for hostile PD.",,,
SRD_Maris,SHIP,"Equipped with a single Lucidas beam emitter, the Maris is capable of locking down and disabling smaller ships, making them easy prey.",,,
SRD_Sivva,SHIP,"Armed with a downsized stricture beam, the Sivva is purpose-built for stripping even larger battleships of armor and soften them up for their allies. Their effectiveness against shielded targets is lackluster however.",,,
SRD_Eolia,SHIP,"Part of the 5th generation carrier initiative, the Eolia was designed from the ground up to eventually replace the aging Hubris-class battlecarrier. Optimized for drone fighters, it surpasses the Hubris in bay capacity, but is incapable of being equipped with manned fighter craft.",,,
SRD_Tilia,SHIP,"A small 5th generation vessel, focusing entirely on projecting fighter power on the battlefield. By equipping one of the bays with a specialized nanoforge for Maris-class disabler fighters, it was possible to make enough room for the ship to service a total of 3 fighter wings. While highly efficient, it is limited to drone fighters as the bays lack any way for pilot access.",,,
SRD_Replekia,SHIP,"A prototype battleship developed by Sylphon during the 4th generation nanolaminate armor project. Originally meant as the top of this new line of ships, the design was ultimately discarded due to immense cost. How many of these prototype vessels were actually constructed is unclear, but they can rarely be seen within Sylphon systems.

Designed for broadside combat, employing its enhanced defenses, the Replekia is a rather unusual design by Sylphon standards, but is undeniably effective and one would wonder how a strike group of these vessels would fare in combat.",,,
SRD_Metafalica,SHIP,"Unknown to many, the design of the Replekia wasn't a new development as part of the nanofilament research initiative like the smaller vessels that came from said project, rather its design is based on a now abandoned prototype battleship.

The Metafalica was designed to be the new core of the growing Sylphon fleet roster as part of the first wave of warships designed for full Nulltech integration. Equipped with every new piece of technology the corporation had to offer at time of design, the prototype ship was a true marvel to behold. Mounting three advanced variable ammunition cannons, capable of adapting to any combat situation and an advanced counterforce-charged armor, it seemed without question that the Metafalica would be dominating any battle Sylphon would find itself involved in. Reality set in soon after however as the project proved too ambitious for its own good. Estimated production costs for the new vessel proved exorbitant and the Equilibrium it had been developed alongside proved the more efficient alternative for a new battleship. The project was scrapped and the 4 built prototypes were put in storage where they are said to remain to this day. 

Rumours however say that at least one of the original prototypes was stolen by a former member of the board of directions after a disagreement over Sylphon's inaction over a [REDACTED] attack on a nearby inhabited system, supposedly having taken the ship to wage their own personal war with. Multiple reports have surfaced in recent years of a ship matching the Metafalica's rough description active in the outer fringes of [REDACTED] space, acting as part of a seemingly growing hunter fleet, engaging [REDACTED] on sight without mercy.",,,
SRD_Eagle_P,SHIP,"Based on the Dread Eagle, the Scourge Eagle is an outcast-modified design, adapting it to comply with outcast combat doctrine. With most of its mounts upgraded to support ballistic weapons and the addition of counterforce armor, this reliable cruiser has become more sturdy than its base model. The added mass however has affected its mobility, in particular limiting the range of its signature jaunt drive. Reconfigured to account for this, the new Slip Drive tries to make up for this limited range with a set of fast-charging capacitors.

As many Dread Eagles were being phased out to be replaced with newer cruiser designs at the time of the exodus, the Outcast took many of these ships with them. The ships were later adapted for combat against [REDACTED] with upgrades based on the experimental technologies used in the Metafalica.",,,
SRD_Celika_P,SHIP,"A favorite of many Sylphon commanders, many Celika-class drone frigates found their way into the Outcast navy. In addition to the usual upgrades with hybrid mounts and counterforce-armor, the Celika Rel also replaces its signature nullpoint barrier with a more offensive nullspace shunt system, instead relying on the improved armor for protection.",,,
SRD_Myrigo,SHIP,Advanced fighter-bomber carrying 6 Harrow-type missiles capable of engaging targets of any size. Also carries a small PD beamer for support.,,,
SRD_Misja,SHIP,"A versatile drone employed by the Outcast, coming in configurations for various support roles.",,,
SRD_Nalka,SHIP,"Outfitted with a pair of downsized rail accelerators, the Nalka is designed to suppress shielded targets in advance of an assault.",,,
SRD_Infel,SHIP,"A high-performance fighter designed for the Replekia, its autofactory is fully integrated and incompatible with other ships. ",,,
SRD_Vril,SHIP,"An advanced frigate, recently put into service by Sylphon RnD, its true capabilities are still unknown.
",,,
SRD_Synastry,SHIP,"The Synastry is an advanced EWAR-Cruiser rarely seen in Sylphon's fleets. Their reliance on alpha-level AI cores as central control unit makes these ship expensive to build and difficult to find willing operators for. Their effectiveness, however, cannot be denied as the Synastry is capable of providing a wide range of fleet support in and out of battle.

The first of these vessels were initially constructed in the early years after the First AI War from the recovered hulls of Brilliant-class cruisers. Originally intended as a makeshift surveying vessel in this new post-collapse world, the Synastry fulfilled its role better than initially expected. Following this initial success, a number of overhauls for the class were greenlit to turn what was once a makeshift vessel into a military-grade EWAR platform. While the increased complexity of these extensive upgrades eventually necessitated the integration of alpha-level cores to provide enough processing power to handle all its systems, the increased difficulty of finding willing alphas was a price well worth paying.",,,
SRD_Vetra,SHIP,"A basic missile drone, carrying a single Raphiel-class missile. Simple but effective when supporting other strike craft to soften up targets.",,,
,,,,,
SRD_Fulgent,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the TriTachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. So the official histories say.

Host to an endless swarm of drone fighters, the Iridescent is a flying factory, projecting devastating fighter screens across any battle. Housing the fighter complement of a dedicated supercarrier, one wouldn't expect this ship to have much room for direct firepower. A wrong thought.",,,

sylphon,FACTION,"Once the Sylphon Institute for AI research, this small corporation has become a major technology contractor in the sector, providing technical support in many areas to most factions of the sector. From fleet maintenance services to state-funded military development projects, Sylphon RnD have various long-running contracts with the Persean Leage, Sindrian Diktat, Tri-Tachyon and many independent governments. While politically insignificant, Sylphon have attracted the ire of the Hegemony and Luddites across the sector due to a seemingly liberal use of AI technology.

Secretive in nature, Sylphon are based on the outer edge of the sector, avoiding involvement in sector politics and restricting themselves to a limited number of facilities that allow them independent operation without attracting too much attention. Especially in recent years the corporation has been focusing on developing a new set of exotic technologies never before seen in the sector. Some speculate that this new “Nulltech” has prompted a worrying military buildup of the faction given an ever expanding roster of new and exotic ship designs spotted around Sylphon facilities and planets, but such claims have been dismissed by most factions given the small corporation’s lack of manpower, making it highly unlikely to ever pose a true military threat.",,,
