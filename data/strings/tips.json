		"When fielding a large number of Sylphon ships, equipping your remaining fleet with Modular Nullspace Conduits can let them benefit from synergetic effects and protect them from harmful nullspace lightning.",
		"Mixing purple Sylphon equipment with green Shadowyards equipment is a sure sign of a bad sense for aesthetics.",
		"Purple is justice.",
		"Missiles should be 0 OP, really.",
		"AIs are friends, don't hurt them.",
		"Pink Onslaught was also a mistake.",

		"Missiles should have unlimited ammo, really.",
		"You can never have too many reapers.",
		"Should you run into someone blabbering about how Nullspace is the realm of the gods, you should probably get away from them.",
		"Ever found an Outcast blueprint package? Consider playing the lottery.",
		"Where are all those odd ships in the Sylphon test mission that I can't find in the campaign? They are in Nia-makes-too-many-things-at-once-and-doesn't-finish-all-of-them-land.",
